The provided Python code implements a linear regression model to predict house prices using features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The process starts by importing necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The dataset is loaded and split into features (X) and target variable (y, representing price). The data is then divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split. A LinearRegression model from scikit-learn is trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the test set. Finally, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which indicate how close the predicted prices are to the actual prices. This approach is useful for understanding how different factors contribute to housing prices and making informed estimates.
